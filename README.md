TODO: Add description on branching vs. forking

### With Branching:

#### 1. Cloning

To start, you'll need to **clone** this **remote** repository, which creates a **local** repository.

`git clone` creates a new directory at your current location. For example, if I type:

TODO: Clean up this language/flow
```
$ pwd
/home/grace
```

```
$ git clone <repository-url>
```

Then, switch directories into your local repository:
```
$ cd <repository-name>
$ pwd
/home/grace/<repository-name>
```

#### 2. Branching


#### 3. Adding/committing

#### 4. Pushing

#### 5. Updating your branch

#### 6. Merging

#### 7. Making a Pull Request


### With Forking:

#### 1. Forking

Fork = copy (basically)

Go to the repository you want to fork: https://github.com/garoller/git-workshop

Click the Fork button. This creates your own copy of the repository.

Now go to https://github.com/some-username/git-workshop to find the fork.

#### 2. See Cloning above.

#### 3. See Adding/committing above.

#### 4. See Pushing above.

#### 5. Updating your fork

Set upstream

#### 6. Merging

#### 7. Making a Pull Request
